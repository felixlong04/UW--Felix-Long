    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>This page says a bit more about me.</p>
    
  <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in San Diego, California. I played soccer, volleyball, and ran track. I love the beach. I used to go to the beach all the time as a kid, building sandcastles, boogyboarding, and getting sunburnt. When I retire, I have to be by a beach! .</p>

  <p>These are my <strong>favorite</strong> beaches in San Diego:
   <ul>
    <li>Torrey Pines</li>
    <li>Solona</li>
    <li>La Jolla</li>
    <li>Carlsbad</li>
    <li>Del Mar</li>
   </ul>
  </p> 
  <p>Torrey Pines is my personal favorite. Look at this view from the hike right next to the beach!
